## Abstract

This document proposes various boot modes for starting up the application.

## Proposal

The document outlines four startup modes for the application: `normal`, `safe`,
`dev`, and `safe-dev`. In `normal` mode, the application starts up using the user
configuration. Safe mode assumes that startup failure is caused by configuration
corruption, so the application starts up using a temporary folder and default
configuration. In `dev` mode, the logging level is adjusted to print debug
information. Finally, in `safe-dev` mode, the application starts up using a
temporary folder and default configuration while also printing debug information.

## Rational

By offering multiple boot modes, users have the flexibility to choose the
startup behavior that best suits their needs or resolves any issues they may
encounter. The inclusion of `safe` modes (`safe` and `safe-dev`) ensures that the
application can recover gracefully from potential configuration corruption or
other startup failures, minimizing downtime and providing a smoother user
experience. The `dev` and `safe-dev` modes cater to developers or administrators
by enabling verbose logging and debug information, which can be invaluable for
diagnosing and resolving issues during development or troubleshooting.
